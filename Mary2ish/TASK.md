## **Project Phases & Task Breakdown**

### **Phase 1: Setup & Core Local Integration**

**Goal:** Establish the foundational environment, integrate fast-agent.ai with a basic LLM, and get a minimal Streamlit application running locally via Python.

#### **Tasks:**

* [x] **1.1. Project Repository Setup:**  
  * [x] Initialize basic project structure (e.g., app/, config/, README.md).  
* [x] **1.2. Streamlit Basic App Development:**  
  * [x] Create a minimal app/main.py Streamlit application.  
  * [x] Add a simple text input box and a display area for output.  
  * [x] Implement st.set\_page\_config(layout="wide", initial\_sidebar\_state="collapsed").  
* [x] **1.3. fast-agent.ai Configuration Setup:**  
  * [x] Create placeholder config/fastagent/system\_prompt.txt.  
  * [x] Create placeholder config/fastagent/fastagent.config.yaml (e.g., defining a basic LLM provider).  
  * [x] Create placeholder config/fastagent/fastagent.secrets.yaml (e.g., for an API key).  
* [x] **1.4. fast-agent.ai Integration:**  
  * [x] In app/main.py, import and initialize fast-agent.ai.  
  * [x] Implement a basic chat loop: user input \-\> fast-agent.ai call \-\> display response.  
  * [x] Ensure fast-agent.ai loads configurations from the specified local path (which will later be mounted in Docker).  
* [x] **1.5. Local Application Run (Python):**  
  * [x] Successfully run the Streamlit application locally using streamlit run app/main.py.  
  * [x] Verify the Streamlit app is accessible via localhost:8501.

#### **Testing & User Acceptance (Phase 1):**

* [x] **1.6. Internal Testing:**  
  * [x] Confirm Streamlit app launches successfully locally.  
  * [x] Test basic chat interaction: input text, receive a response from the LLM via fast-agent.ai.  
  * [x] Validate that fast-agent.ai is correctly loading configuration from the local config/fastagent directory.  
* [x] **1.7. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) \- Internal Stakeholders:**  
  * [x] Demonstrate the basic chat functionality to project stakeholders.  
  * [x] Confirm the minimalist Streamlit UI is acceptable for initial embeddability.
  * **COMPLETED:** July 2, 2025 - User confirmed thinking response handling works perfectly, chat functionality tested and approved
* [x] **1.8. Handle LLM Thinking Responses:**
  * [x] Detect `<think>` and `</think>` tags in LLM responses

  * [x] **ENHANCEMENT ITERATION:** Further improved function call and metadata filtering after user feedback
  * [x] **ENHANCEMENT ITERATION:** Enhanced `process_mcp_response_enhanced()` with complete function call block removal
  * [x] **ENHANCEMENT ITERATION:** Added comprehensive tests for enhanced filtering (4 new test cases)
  * Added: July 2, 2025 - Issue: Agent config includes MCP servers but they are not being initialized during agent startup
  * **COMPLETED:** July 2, 2025 - Implemented automatic MCP server discovery, connection, graceful fallback handling, and clean response processing

  * [ ] Embed the Streamlit app in an iframe with initial styling.  
  * [ ] Implement window.addEventListener('message', ...) in parent\_page.html to receive height updates and adjust the iframe's style.  
  * [ ] Add sandbox attribute to the iframe in parent\_page.html with appropriate permissions.  
* [ ] **2.4. Error Message Display:**  
  * [ ] Implement UI elements to display user-friendly error messages if fast-agent.ai encounters an issue (e.g., LLM API error, config loading error).

  * [ ] Full functional testing of refactored app

#### **Testing & User Acceptance (Phase 2):**

* [ ] **2.5. Internal Testing:**  
  * [ ] Verify the Streamlit UI is clean and minimal when viewed directly and within the sample parent\_page.html.  
  * [ ] Test dynamic iframe resizing by changing content (e.g., long responses) and resizing the parent browser window.  
  * [ ] Simulate LLM errors and confirm the user-friendly error messages are displayed.  
* [ ] **2.6. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) \- External Integration Team:**  
  * [ ] Provide the sample parent\_page.html and instructions for embedding.
