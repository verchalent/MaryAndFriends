## **Project Phases & Task Breakdown**

### **Phase 1: Setup & Core Local Integration**

**Goal:** Establish the foundational environment, integrate fast-agent.ai with a basic LLM, and get a minimal Streamlit application running locally via Python.

#### **Tasks:**

* [x] **1.1. Project Repository Setup:**  
  * [x] Initialize basic project structure (e.g., app/, config/, README.md).  
* [x] **1.2. Streamlit Basic App Development:**  
  * [x] Create a minimal app/main.py Streamlit application.  
  * [x] Add a simple text input box and a display area for output.  
  * [x] Implement st.set\_page\_config(layout="wide", initial\_sidebar\_state="collapsed").  
* [x] **1.3. fast-agent.ai Configuration Setup:**  
  * [x] Create placeholder config/fastagent/system\_prompt.txt.  
  * [x] Create placeholder config/fastagent/fastagent.config.yaml (e.g., defining a basic LLM provider).  
  * [x] Create placeholder config/fastagent/fastagent.secrets.yaml (e.g., for an API key).  
* [x] **1.4. fast-agent.ai Integration:**  
  * [x] In app/main.py, import and initialize fast-agent.ai.  
  * [x] Implement a basic chat loop: user input \-\> fast-agent.ai call \-\> display response.  
  * [x] Ensure fast-agent.ai loads configurations from the specified local path (which will later be mounted in Docker).  
* [x] **1.5. Local Application Run (Python):**  
  * [x] Successfully run the Streamlit application locally using streamlit run app/main.py.  
  * [x] Verify the Streamlit app is accessible via localhost:8501.

#### **Testing & User Acceptance (Phase 1):**

* [x] **1.6. Internal Testing:**  
  * [x] Confirm Streamlit app launches successfully locally.  
  * [x] Test basic chat interaction: input text, receive a response from the LLM via fast-agent.ai.  
  * [x] Validate that fast-agent.ai is correctly loading configuration from the local config/fastagent directory.  
* [x] **1.7. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) \- Internal Stakeholders:**  
  * [x] Demonstrate the basic chat functionality to project stakeholders.  
  * [x] Confirm the minimalist Streamlit UI is acceptable for initial embeddability.
  * **COMPLETED:** July 2, 2025 - User confirmed thinking response handling works perfectly, chat functionality tested and approved
* [x] **1.8. Handle LLM Thinking Responses:**
  * [x] Detect `<think>` and `</think>` tags in LLM responses
  * [x] Implement collapsible UI for thinking sections (preferred) or filter them out entirely
  * [x] Ensure clean user experience by hiding reasoning process from main chat display
  * [x] Add option for power users to view thinking process if desired
  * Added: July 2, 2025 - Issue: LLM responses include both reasoning (`<think>` tags) and actual response, cluttering the UI
  * **COMPLETED:** July 2, 2025 - Implemented regex-based processing to separate thinking from responses, added collapsible expander UI
* [x] **1.9. UI Configuration Customization:**
  * [x] Create ui.config.yaml for customizable UI elements
  * [x] Support configurable page title, agent display name, and page header
  * [x] Update ChatApp class to load and apply UI configuration
  * [x] Create tests for UI configuration loading
  * [x] Enhanced chat message styling with better distinction between speaker names and message content
  * Added: July 2, 2025 - User requested ability to customize page title, agent display name, and header text
  * **COMPLETED:** July 2, 2025 - Implemented UI configuration file, enhanced styling with clear visual separation between speakers and content

**Phase 1 Complete:** [x] - Completed July 2, 2025

### **Discovered Issues Before Phase 2:**

#### **Tasks:**

* [x] **1.10. MCP Server Integration:**
  * [x] Update agent initialization to include any MCP servers defined in fastagent.config.yaml
  * [x] Ensure MCP servers are properly connected at agent launch time
  * [x] Test connectivity to configured MCP servers (e.g., wikijs server at inari.localdomain:8004)
  * [x] Handle MCP connection errors gracefully with appropriate logging
  * [x] **ENHANCEMENT:** Filter MCP server response data from user-facing responses
  * [x] **ENHANCEMENT:** Add collapsible "Server Data" section for debugging/power users
  * [x] **ENHANCEMENT:** Comprehensive response processing to separate thinking, MCP data, and human-readable content
  * [x] **ENHANCEMENT ITERATION:** Further improved function call and metadata filtering after user feedback
  * [x] **ENHANCEMENT ITERATION:** Enhanced `process_mcp_response_enhanced()` with complete function call block removal
  * [x] **ENHANCEMENT ITERATION:** Added comprehensive tests for enhanced filtering (4 new test cases)
  * Added: July 2, 2025 - Issue: Agent config includes MCP servers but they are not being initialized during agent startup
  * **COMPLETED:** July 2, 2025 - Implemented automatic MCP server discovery, connection, graceful fallback handling, and clean response processing

**Discovered Issues Complete:** [x]

### **Phase 2: UI Refinements & Embeddability**

**Goal:** Enhance the Streamlit UI for better user experience within an iframe and implement dynamic iframe sizing.

#### **Tasks:**

* [ ] **2.1. Streamlit UI Styling & Minimalism:**  
  * [ ] Apply custom CSS (via st.markdown with unsafe\_allow\_html=True) to hide any remaining Streamlit artifacts (e.g., "Deploy" button, footer).  
  * [ ] Refine chat message display (e.g., distinct styling for user/AI messages).  
  * [ ] Ensure responsive layout for various iframe sizes.  
* [ ] **2.2. Dynamic Iframe Sizing (Streamlit Side):**  
  * [ ] Implement JavaScript injection in app/main.py to measure document.body.scrollHeight.  
  * [ ] Use window.parent.postMessage() to send the height to the parent window periodically.  
* [ ] **2.3. Dynamic Iframe Sizing (Parent HTML Example):**  
  * [ ] Create a sample parent\_page.html file.  
  * [ ] Embed the Streamlit app in an iframe with initial styling.  
  * [ ] Implement window.addEventListener('message', ...) in parent\_page.html to receive height updates and adjust the iframe's style.  
  * [ ] Add sandbox attribute to the iframe in parent\_page.html with appropriate permissions.  
* [ ] **2.4. Error Message Display:**  
  * [ ] Implement UI elements to display user-friendly error messages if fast-agent.ai encounters an issue (e.g., LLM API error, config loading error).
* [ ] **2.5. Code Refactoring & Modularization:**
  * [x] Extract CSS and styling to `app/styles/chat_styles.py`
  * [x] Extract response processing functions to `app/utils/response_processing.py`
  * [x] Create configuration manager in `app/config/config_manager.py`
  * [x] Create error display utilities in `app/utils/error_display.py`
  * [x] Refactor ChatApp class to `app/components/chat_interface.py`
  * [x] Refactor main.py to be a lean orchestration file (under 130 lines)
  * [x] Create proper entry point (`main.py` in project root)
  * [x] Update start.sh script to use new entry point
  * [x] Test refactored application runs successfully with Streamlit
  * [x] Create documentation of refactoring process and new structure
  * [ ] Update tests to cover new module structure (partially broken after refactor)
  * [ ] Full functional testing of refactored app

#### **Testing & User Acceptance (Phase 2):**

* [ ] **2.5. Internal Testing:**  
  * [ ] Verify the Streamlit UI is clean and minimal when viewed directly and within the sample parent\_page.html.  
  * [ ] Test dynamic iframe resizing by changing content (e.g., long responses) and resizing the parent browser window.  
  * [ ] Simulate LLM errors and confirm the user-friendly error messages are displayed.  
* [ ] **2.6. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) \- External Integration Team:**  
  * [ ] Provide the sample parent\_page.html and instructions for embedding.  
  * [ ] Confirm the chat interface embeds cleanly and resizes dynamically in various test environments.  
  * [ ] Gather feedback on UI/UX for embedded use.
