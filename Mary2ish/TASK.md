## **Project Phases & Task Breakdown**

### **Phase 1: Setup & Core Local Integration**

**Goal:** Establish the foundational environment, integrate fast-agent.ai with a basic LLM, and get a minimal Streamlit application running locally via Python.

#### **Tasks:**

* [x] **1.1. Project Repository Setup:**  
  * [x] Initialize basic project structure (e.g., app/, config/, README.md).  
* [x] **1.2. Streamlit Basic App Development:**  
  * [x] Create a minimal app/main.py Streamlit application.  
  * [x] Add a simple text input box and a display area for output.  
  * [x] Implement st.set\_page\_config(layout="wide", initial\_sidebar\_state="collapsed").  
* [x] **1.3. fast-agent.ai Configuration Setup:**  
  * [x] Create placeholder config/fastagent/system\_prompt.txt.  
  * [x] Create placeholder config/fastagent/fastagent.config.yaml (e.g., defining a basic LLM provider).  
  * [x] Create placeholder config/fastagent/fastagent.secrets.yaml (e.g., for an API key).  
* [x] **1.4. fast-agent.ai Integration:**  
  * [x] In app/main.py, import and initialize fast-agent.ai.  
  * [x] Implement a basic chat loop: user input \-\> fast-agent.ai call \-\> display response.  
  * [x] Ensure fast-agent.ai loads configurations from the specified local path (which will later be mounted in Docker).  
* [x] **1.5. Local Application Run (Python):**  
  * [x] Successfully run the Streamlit application locally using streamlit run app/main.py.  
  * [x] Verify the Streamlit app is accessible via localhost:8501.

#### **Testing & User Acceptance (Phase 1):**

* [x] **1.6. Internal Testing:**  
  * [x] Confirm Streamlit app launches successfully locally.  
  * [x] Test basic chat interaction: input text, receive a response from the LLM via fast-agent.ai.  
  * [x] Validate that fast-agent.ai is correctly loading configuration from the local config/fastagent directory.  
* [ ] **1.7. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) \- Internal Stakeholders:**  
  * [ ] Demonstrate the basic chat functionality to project stakeholders.  
  * [ ] Confirm the minimalist Streamlit UI is acceptable for initial embeddability.

**Phase 1 Complete:** [ ]

### **Phase 2: UI Refinements & Embeddability**

**Goal:** Enhance the Streamlit UI for better user experience within an iframe and implement dynamic iframe sizing.

#### **Tasks:**

* [ ] **2.1. Streamlit UI Styling & Minimalism:**  
  * [ ] Apply custom CSS (via st.markdown with unsafe\_allow\_html=True) to hide any remaining Streamlit artifacts (e.g., "Deploy" button, footer).  
  * [ ] Refine chat message display (e.g., distinct styling for user/AI messages).  
  * [ ] Ensure responsive layout for various iframe sizes.  
* [ ] **2.2. Dynamic Iframe Sizing (Streamlit Side):**  
  * [ ] Implement JavaScript injection in app/main.py to measure document.body.scrollHeight.  
  * [ ] Use window.parent.postMessage() to send the height to the parent window periodically.  
* [ ] **2.3. Dynamic Iframe Sizing (Parent HTML Example):**  
  * [ ] Create a sample parent\_page.html file.  
  * [ ] Embed the Streamlit app in an iframe with initial styling.  
  * [ ] Implement window.addEventListener('message', ...) in parent\_page.html to receive height updates and adjust the iframe's style.  
  * [ ] Add sandbox attribute to the iframe in parent\_page.html with appropriate permissions.  
* [ ] **2.4. Error Message Display:**  
  * [ ] Implement UI elements to display user-friendly error messages if fast-agent.ai encounters an issue (e.g., LLM API error, config loading error).

#### **Testing & User Acceptance (Phase 2):**

* [ ] **2.5. Internal Testing:**  
  * [ ] Verify the Streamlit UI is clean and minimal when viewed directly and within the sample parent\_page.html.  
  * [ ] Test dynamic iframe resizing by changing content (e.g., long responses) and resizing the parent browser window.  
  * [ ] Simulate LLM errors and confirm the user-friendly error messages are displayed.  
* [ ] **2.6. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) \- External Integration Team:**  
  * [ ] Provide the sample parent\_page.html and instructions for embedding.  
  * [ ] Confirm the chat interface embeds cleanly and resizes dynamically in various test environments.  
  * [ ] Gather feedback on UI/UX for embedded use.

**Phase 2 Complete:** [ ]

### **Phase 3: Dockerization & Configuration Hardening**

**Goal:** Containerize the application, ensure robust configuration loading within Docker, and prepare for production deployment.

#### **Tasks:**

* [ ] **3.1. Dockerfile Creation (Initial):**  
  * [ ] Create a Dockerfile to install Python, Streamlit, and fast-agent.ai.  
  * [ ] Define the entry point to run the Streamlit application within the container.  
* [ ] **3.2. Local Docker Build & Run (Initial):**  
  * [ ] Successfully build the Docker image.  
  * [ ] Run the container locally, mounting the config/fastagent directory to /app/config/fastagent inside the container.  
  * [ ] Verify the Streamlit app is accessible via localhost:8501 from the container.  
* [ ] **3.3. Dockerfile Optimization:**  
  * [ ] Implement multi-stage builds for smaller image size.  
  * [ ] Add non-root user for security.  
  * [ ] Ensure all necessary dependencies are included and unnecessary ones removed.  
* [ ] **3.4. Configuration Loading Logic (Containerized):**  
  * [ ] Refine app/main.py to robustly load system\_prompt.txt, fastagent.config.yaml, and fastagent.secrets.yaml from the /app/config/fastagent path *within the Docker container*.  
  * [ ] Implement error handling for missing or malformed configuration files.  
* [ ] **3.5. Environment Variable Handling:**  
  * [ ] Ensure that sensitive information (e.g., API keys) is primarily accessed via environment variables within fastagent.secrets.yaml and not directly in code.  
  * [ ] Document how to pass environment variables during docker run.  
* [ ] **3.6. Logging Implementation:**  
  * [ ] Set up structured logging within app/main.py and fast-agent.ai interactions.  
  * [ ] Configure logging to output to stdout for Docker compatibility.  
* [ ] **3.7. README & Documentation Update:**  
  * [ ] Update README.md with comprehensive instructions for building, running, and configuring the Docker container.  
  * [ ] Include details on mounting configuration files and setting environment variables.  
  * [ ] Add instructions for embedding the iframe on a parent page.

#### **Testing & User Acceptance (Phase 3):**

* [ ] **3.8. Internal Testing:**  
  * [ ] Build and run the optimized Docker image. Verify size reduction.  
  * [ ] Test with various valid and invalid configurations (missing files, incorrect API keys) to ensure robust error handling and logging *within the Docker container*.  
  * [ ] Verify all configuration values are correctly loaded and applied *when running in Docker*.  
  * [ ] Review logs for clarity and completeness from the Docker container.  
* [ ] **3.9. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) \- DevOps/Deployment Team:**  
  * [ ] Provide the Docker image and comprehensive documentation.  
  * [ ] Have the DevOps team attempt to deploy and configure the application in a staging environment using only the provided documentation.  
  * [ ] Gather feedback on deployment process, configuration clarity, and logging.

**Phase 3 Complete:** [ ]

### **Phase 4: Final Testing, Acceptance & Documentation**

**Goal:** Conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing, secure final user acceptance, and prepare for release.

#### **Tasks:**

* [ ] **4.1. End-to-End Functional Testing:**  
  * [ ] Test all chat functionalities with various prompts, including edge cases.  
  * [ ] Verify fast-agent.ai correctly routes to configured LLMs.  
  * [ ] Confirm chat history is maintained within the session.  
* [ ] **4.2. Performance Testing (Basic):**  
  * [ ] Conduct basic load testing to ensure the app remains responsive under expected user concurrency.  
  * [ ] Monitor resource usage within the Docker container.  
* [ ] **4.3. Security Review:**  
  * [ ] Review iframe sandboxing attributes with the security team.  
  * [ ] Confirm no sensitive information is exposed client-side.  
* [ ] **4.4. Final Documentation Review:**  
  * [ ] Review all project documentation (README.md, any internal guides) for accuracy, completeness, and clarity.  
  * [ ] Ensure all assumptions and limitations are clearly stated.

#### **Testing & User Acceptance (Phase 4):**

* [ ] **4.5. Comprehensive Internal Testing:**  
  * [ ] Execute all test cases, including regression tests from previous phases.  
  * [ ] Verify all error handling scenarios.  
* [ ] **4.6. Final User Acceptance Testing (UAT) \- All Stakeholders:**  
  * [ ] Conduct a final UAT session with all relevant stakeholders (product owners, integration teams, potential end-users).  
  * [ ] Obtain formal sign-off for release.

**Phase 4 Complete:** [ ]
