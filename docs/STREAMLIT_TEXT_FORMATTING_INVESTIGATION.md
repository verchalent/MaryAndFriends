**Date:** July 11, 2025  
**Issue:** Text formatting problems in Streamlit chat interface with code blocks and markdown content  
**Status- **Performance**: Efficient parsing with minimal overhead

### Deployment Validation ✅

- ✅ Podman container rebuilt and deployed with enhanced markdown code
- ✅ Mary2ish interface running successfully at <http://localhost:8501>
- ✅ User confirmation: "This looks much better" - formatting issues resolved
- ✅ Code blocks now display properly with syntax highlighting
- ✅ No more `[object Object]` raw text display issues

## Investigation SummaryInvestigation  

## Problem Description

Based on the attached image and nixlog.txt output, there appears to be a text formatting issue in the Mary2ish Streamlit chat interface. The issue manifests as:

1. **Code block rendering problems** - Code sections appear to be displaying raw markdown rather than properly formatted code blocks
2. **Line wrapping issues** - Text content appears to be poorly formatted within the chat interface boxes
3. **Markdown parsing inconsistencies** - Mixed rendering where some markdown is processed and some remains as raw text

## Evidence Analysis

### From nixlog.txt:
- The agent is successfully providing detailed Nix flake explanations
- Content includes properly structured markdown with:
  - Code blocks (```nix, ```bash)
  - Headers (###, ###)
  - Lists and bullet points
  - Inline code (`code`)
- The output suggests the agent is generating correct markdown format

### From Attached Image:
- The chat interface appears to be having trouble rendering the markdown content properly
- Code blocks may not be displaying with proper syntax highlighting
- Text appears to be wrapped or formatted inconsistently within the chat bubbles

## Technical Context

### Current Architecture:
- **Frontend:** Streamlit-based chat interface
- **Agent:** Mary2ish using fast-agent framework
- **Text Processing:** Likely using Streamlit's native markdown rendering

### Potential Root Causes:

1. **Streamlit Markdown Limitations:**
   - Streamlit's `st.markdown()` may have limitations with complex markdown
   - Chat container styling might interfere with code block rendering

2. **CSS/Styling Conflicts:**
   - Custom chat styling may override default markdown styles
   - Code block CSS might not be properly applied

3. **Text Processing Pipeline:**
   - Agent response processing might be stripping or altering markdown
   - Line breaks or whitespace handling issues

4. **Streamlit Chat Elements:**
   - Using `st.chat_message()` vs `st.markdown()` for different content types
   - Mixed content handling (text + code blocks)

## Investigation Plan

1. **Review Current Implementation:**
   - ✅ Examine Mary2ish chat interface code
   - ✅ Check how agent responses are processed and displayed
   - ✅ Identify text formatting pipeline

2. **Research Solutions:**
   - ✅ Use Context7 to research Streamlit markdown best practices
   - ⏳ Look into Streamlit code block rendering options
   - ⏳ Investigate chat interface formatting patterns

3. **Test Potential Fixes:**
   - ⏳ Implement proper code block handling
   - ⏳ Improve markdown processing pipeline
   - ⏳ Test with various content types

## Key Findings

### Root Cause Identified
The issue is in the `process_markdown_to_html()` function in `/Mary2ish/app/utils/response_processing.py`. This function only handles basic markdown formatting:
- **bold** → `<strong>`
- *italic* → `<em>`  
- `inline code` → `<code>`
- [links](url) → `<a>`

**But it does NOT handle code blocks (```language)**, which are the main issue seen in the nixlog.txt output.

### Current Architecture Analysis
1. **Chat Interface:** Uses custom HTML rendering with `unsafe_allow_html=True`
2. **Response Processing:** Custom markdown-to-HTML conversion instead of Streamlit's native markdown
3. **Code Block Handling:** Missing entirely - this is the core problem

### Solution Approach
Based on Context7 research, the best approach is to:
1. **Use `st.code()` for code blocks** instead of trying to convert to HTML
2. **Parse markdown content** to identify code blocks separately
3. **Render mixed content** using a combination of `st.markdown()` and `st.code()`

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Create this investigation document
2. ✅ Use Context7 to research Streamlit text formatting solutions
3. ✅ Examine current Mary2ish implementation
4. ✅ Identify specific formatting issues (ROOT CAUSE FOUND)
5. ✅ Implement proper code block parsing and rendering
6. ✅ Test with nixlog.txt content and other mixed content
7. ✅ Document solution and update Mary2ish

## Solution Implementation

### Files Created/Modified

1. **NEW: `/Mary2ish/app/utils/enhanced_markdown.py`**
   - `parse_markdown_content()`: Parses mixed markdown into structured blocks
   - `render_content_blocks()`: Renders blocks using appropriate Streamlit functions
   - `render_enhanced_markdown()`: Main function for enhanced rendering
   - `test_enhanced_markdown()`: Test function with sample content

2. **MODIFIED: `/Mary2ish/app/components/chat_interface.py`**
   - Updated imports to include `enhanced_markdown`
   - Modified `render_response_with_thinking()` to use enhanced rendering
   - Updated message display loop to use enhanced rendering for both user and assistant messages

3. **MODIFIED: `/Mary2ish/app/styles/chat_styles.py`**
   - Updated CSS for container-based message structure
   - Added specific styling for code blocks in chat messages
   - Improved compatibility with Streamlit's native components

4. **NEW: `/Mary2ish/tests/test_enhanced_markdown.py`**
   - Test script to verify enhanced markdown rendering
   - Contains sample content from nixlog.txt for testing

5. **NEW: `/Mary2ish/tests/test_markdown_parsing.py`**
   - Standalone parsing tests for enhanced markdown functionality
   - Validates parsing logic with multiple test cases

### How the Solution Works

**Before (Problematic Approach):**
- Used custom `process_markdown_to_html()` function
- Converted everything to HTML manually
- No support for code blocks (```language)
- Code appeared as raw text in chat interface

**After (Enhanced Approach):**
- Parse markdown content into structured blocks (text vs code)
- Use `st.markdown()` for regular text content
- Use `st.code()` for code blocks with proper syntax highlighting
- Maintain chat styling while leveraging Streamlit's native rendering

### Key Benefits

1. **Proper Code Block Rendering**: Code blocks now display with syntax highlighting
2. **Native Streamlit Components**: Leverages Streamlit's built-in markdown and code rendering
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Still supports all existing markdown features
4. **Enhanced Styling**: Improved CSS for code blocks within chat messages
5. **Maintainable**: Cleaner separation of concerns between parsing and rendering

## Testing Results

### Parsing Logic Validation ✅

Using `uv run Mary2ish/tests/test_markdown_parsing.py`, the enhanced markdown parsing was validated with multiple test cases:

**Test 1: Simple code block**
- ✅ Correctly identified 1 code block (nix, 6 lines)
- ✅ Separated surrounding text into 2 text blocks

**Test 2: Multiple code blocks**
- ✅ Correctly identified 2 code blocks (nix + bash)
- ✅ Properly separated text between code blocks

**Test 3: nixlog.txt sample (the problematic content)**
- ✅ Parsed 1 code block (nix, 24 lines) from the complex response
- ✅ Separated 2 text blocks containing explanatory content
- ✅ Preserved all 1,705 characters of content
- ✅ Correctly detected 'nix' language specification

### Streamlit Integration Test ✅
- ✅ Enhanced markdown test server running on http://localhost:8502
- ✅ Streamlit integration working with `uv run -m streamlit`
- ✅ No import errors or dependency issues

### Solution Validation

The enhanced markdown solution successfully addresses all identified issues:

1. **Code Block Rendering**: Now uses `st.code()` with proper syntax highlighting
2. **Mixed Content Handling**: Properly separates and renders text vs code blocks
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains all existing markdown functionality
4. **Performance**: Efficient parsing with minimal overhead

### Deployment Validation ✅
- ✅ Podman container rebuilt and deployed with enhanced markdown code
- ✅ Mary2ish interface running successfully at http://localhost:8501
- ✅ User confirmation: "This looks much better" - formatting issues resolved
- ✅ Code blocks now display properly with syntax highlighting
- ✅ No more `[object Object]` raw text display issues

## Investigation Summary

**Status: ✅ COMPLETED**  
**Date Completed:** July 11, 2025

### Problem Resolution

The Streamlit text formatting issue has been **successfully resolved**. The root cause was identified as inadequate code block handling in the custom markdown-to-HTML conversion process. The solution implements:

1. **Enhanced Markdown Parser**: Separates mixed content into text and code blocks
2. **Native Streamlit Rendering**: Uses `st.markdown()` + `st.code()` instead of custom HTML
3. **Improved Chat Interface**: Updated styling and rendering pipeline
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Validated with real-world content from nixlog.txt
